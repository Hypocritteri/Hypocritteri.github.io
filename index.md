## About Me

Hi, I'm Kalle!

I'm a enthusiastic art student at [Kajaani University of Applied Sciences](https://www.kamk.fi/fi) and this is my humble portfolio hub!

I love to make smaller game projects in my spare time and also try out new features in various different game engines. 

I'm mostly in my comfort zone when doing art, but I have done some programming and trying to figure out some simple mechanics what some games have.
