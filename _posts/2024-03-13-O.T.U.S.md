## Overview
![](/assets/OTUS.png)
O.T.U.S is a metroidvania game, with 2D sprites and 3D environment made with Unreal Engine 5.2. 

I was the only artist in the team, but also had the task of making the sounds and music for the game. 
For most of the art I used Aseprite, Blender and Niagara for in-game VFX. 
Sounds were made by using various ways of generating different sounds and then mixed inside the game engine using MetaSounds. 
I was also responsible for building the game level itself and its lighting.
